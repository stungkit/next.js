System Requirements:

- [Node.js 16.8](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Automatic Installation

We recommend creating a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? No / Yes
```

Next.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default. You can also choose to use the `src` directory for your application code.

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

> **Good to know**: While you can use the [Pages Router](/docs/pages) in your new project. We recommend starting new applications with the App Router to leverage React's latest features.

## Manual Installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Open `package.json` and add the following `scripts`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs [`next dev`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#development) to start Next.js in development mode.
- `build`: runs [`next build`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build) to build the application for production usage.
- `start`: runs [`next start`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#production) to start a Next.js production server.
- `lint`: runs [`next lint`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#lint) to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

### Create the `app` folder

Next, create an `app` folder and add a `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application.

<Image
  alt="App Folder Structure"
  srcLight="/docs/light/app-getting-started.png"
  srcDark="/docs/dark/app-getting-started.png"
  width="1600"
  height="363"
/>

Create a [root layout](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) inside `app/layout.tsx` with the required `<html>` and `<body>` tags:

```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx" switcher
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js" switcher
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Finally, create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

> **Good to know**: If you forget to create `layout.tsx`, Next.js will automatically create this file for you when running the development server with `next dev`.

### Create the `public` folder

You can optionally create a `public` folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

## Run the Development Server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit `app/layout.tsx` or `app/page.tsx` and save to see the updated result in your browser.
